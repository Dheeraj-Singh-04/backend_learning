Today, we have learned to create server in a structured way.

we have, learned a new concept of static file.

Info about static files=>

To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express.

The function signature is:

express.static(root, [options])

The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets. For more information on the options argument, see express.static.

For example, use the following code to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files in a directory named public:

app.use(express.static('public'))

Now, you can load the files that are in the public directory:

http://localhost:3000/images/kitten.jpg

http://localhost:3000/css/style.css

http://localhost:3000/js/app.js

http://localhost:3000/images/bg.png

http://localhost:3000/hello.html

Express looks up the files relative to the static directory, so the name of the static directory is

not part of the URL.

To use multiple static assets directories, call the express.static middleware function multiple

times:

app.use(express.static('public'))

app.use(express.static('files'))

Express looks up the files in the order in which you set the static directories with the express.

static middleware function.

Note

For best results, use a reverse proxy cache to improve performance of serving static assets.

To create a virtual path prefix (where the path does not actually exist in the file system) for

files that are served by the express.static function, specify a mount path for the static

directory, as shown below:

app.use('/static', express.static('public'))

Now, you can load the files that are in the public directory from the /static path prefix.

http://localhost:3000/static/images/kitten.jpg

http://localhost:3000/static/css/style.css

http://localhost:3000/static/js/app.js

http://localhost:3000/static/images/bg.png

http://localhost:3000/static/hello.html

However, the path that you provide to the express.static function is relative to the directory from

where you launch your node process. If you run the express app from another directory, itâ€™s safer

to use the absolute path of the directory that you want to serve:

const path = require('path')

app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(\_\_dirname, 'public')))



setup an error handler

You define error-handling middleware in the same way as other middleware, except with four

arguments instead of three; specifically with the signature (err, req, res, next):

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {

console.error(err.stack)

res.status(500).send('Something broke!')

})
